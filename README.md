# Project-90-Brainstorming-Ideas

Problems: 1. Difficult to wake up even when using alarms
          2. (Especially for a salon) Forgetting your appointments with a client
          3. Having difficulties of stretching and doing yoga



Solutions(Using Technology): 1. Create an alarm app where you set an alarm and in the morning the alarm goes off and starts ringing. But, instead of a button to stop the alarm                                     from ringing, there would be an activity you have to do to get the alarm to stop ringing (e.g. A simple math problem, an easy puzzle, etc..). That                                 way, you will be forced to wake up and do the activity on the app or else you'll hear that annoying ringing of the alarm and cannot get to sleep                                   again.

                             2. Create a salon appointment app where a peron who owns a salon can book their appointments. It will help with organizing their appointments and                                     can help them remember what their client wants and when the client is coming. It will also be an easy access by just an email and password.
                             
                             3. Create a Yoga App where there are stretches and yoga exercises for your needs. There will be various yoga and stretching exercises videos where you                                 can choose from in that app for different uses. For example, a stretching exercise(s) for back pain, knee pain, unflexible people, etc.. This will                                 help many people who want to help cure their knee pain, back pain, etc.. and/or want to become more flexible.
